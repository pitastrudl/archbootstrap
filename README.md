# Custom Archiso repo
Simple repo for testing custom arch install scripts. 

Iso should boot and try to install latest archinstall script that is defined inside. 

Ideally:
- Boot ISO
- Get script
- Launch script
- Identify machine and choose archinstall profile if possible
- Launch ansible playbook and choose vars depending on the hardware
